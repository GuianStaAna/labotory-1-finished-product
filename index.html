  <h1>Story</h1>
  <p align="justify">Argus and Rafaela are a pair of twin angels. Yet the angels of legend are all female, making Argus something of an outcast. While the Monastery of Light utilizes his powers to eradicate all heresy, it&#39;s never even acknowledged his existence. While Argus despises humankind, holding it in the utmost disdain, he once came into possession of a demonic blade in the midst of a battle and at that moment realized that he too was a son of man. That he was orphaned when his parents were slain by other humans. Under the demonic blade&#39;s curse he was overcome by resentment, falling into a demonic state himself as he became the Dark Angel.</p>
  <h1>Abilities</h1>
  <p align="justify">Warmonger: When Argus&#39; blade reaches 100 Malice Energy[amount unknown]. He will launch a Demonic Slash with his next Basic Attack, dealing 180 (+80% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage and recovering 150 (+10% Total Physical Attack) HP. This attack ignores 40% of the target&#39;s Physical Defense
Argus&#39; Demonic Blade gains 5 Malice Energy per second, and each of his Basic Attacks grants 10 Malice Energy. (critical strikes grant an additional 10 energy)</p>
  <p align="justify">Demonic Grip: Argus streches out a demonic hand in the target direction, dealing 125–250 (+60% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage to the first enemy hero or creep hit, stunning them for 0.7 seconds and pulling him and the target towards the other. If no enemy is hit, Argus pulls himself towards the destination instead. Use Again: Argus dashes and strikes in the target direction, dealing 175–300 (+100% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage to enemies along the path.</p>
  <p align="justify">Meteoric Sword: After a short delay, Argus thrusts his Demonic Blade in the target direction, dealing 120–240 (+100% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage to enemies hit (deals 200% damage to minions) and slowing them by 80% for 0.8 seconds, the delay time will decrease as Argus&#39; Attack Speed increases. Enemy heroes hit are Cursed for 4 seconds, during which they will leave a Cursed Trail behind. Argus gains 20% Movement Speed while on a Cursed Trail. Metoric Sword counts as Basic Attack damage and can trigger Attack Effects. Meteoric Sword restores 100 Malice Energy upoj hitting heroes (excess Malice Energy will be kept for the next Basic Attack).</p>
  <p align="justify">	Eternal Evil: Argus draws his Meteoric Sword and removes all debuffs (excluding Suppression) on himself, dealing 150–300 (+50% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage and becoming the Fallen Angel for 4 seconds. If this attack hits an enemy hero, it will enhance Warmonger during his transformation.
Fallen Angel: Gain 40% Movement Speed that decreases over 1 second; When the transformation ends, he converts all his damage dealt to heroes in the Fallen Angel state into HP. If he takes fatal damage, the duration of the Movement Speed boost will be reset, and he will gain Death Immunity for 4 seconds.
Enhanced Warmonger: grants 50-60 Malice Energy (50-40) extra Malice Energy with critical hits). If Death Immunity isn&#39;t triggered during his transformation, the cooldown will be reduced by 50% when the skill ends.</p>
